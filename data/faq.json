    "question": "What is Mr Bigglesworth?",
    "answer": "Mr Bigglesworth is a World of Warcraft database app. It lets you search for items, quests, achievements, quests, and more. And it lets you view Wowhead comments for them. All without having to switch between the game and a browser.\n\nAlso, I have a permit."
  },
  {
    "key": "why",
    "question": "Why did you build this app?",
    "answer": "I hate switching between WoW and my browser every time I need to check a comment to help me find what I'm looking for.\n\nSo I built this."
  },
  {
    "key": "icon",
    "question": "I don't even see Mr Bigglesworth anywere!",
    "answer": "Between server costs, I'm too poor to hire a designer to draw Mr Bigglesworth for the app.\n\nIf you'd like to help, get in touch."
  },
  {
    "key": "comments",
    "question": "Err, those comments look weird. Why does it show Wowhead IDs instead of item, etc, name?",
    "answer": "I'll fix this at some point in the future."

    "key": "feedback",
    "question": "Your app sucks / is great! How do I give feedback?",
    "answer": "I've setup a Discord.\n\nJoin here https://discord.gg/9yWny58"
